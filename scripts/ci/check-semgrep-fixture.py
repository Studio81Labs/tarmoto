"""Verify semgrep findings against the ``ruleid:`` / ``ok:`` annotations in a fixture.

Why this exists rather than a count comparison: comparing totals passes when one
expected line stops matching and one ``ok:`` line starts, which is exactly the
regression the negative cases are for. It also passes a rule that fires on
everything, as long as the number happens to line up. Only a per-line comparison
checks what the annotations claim.

``semgrep --test`` is the documented tool for this and does not work here: it
reports "No unit tests found" for a correctly placed Dart fixture and exits 0,
because test discovery keys off the rule's language and Dart is Experimental.

Annotations follow semgrep's convention -- the comment sits on the line directly
above the code it describes:

    // ruleid: some-rule      the next line MUST produce a finding for some-rule
    // ok: some-rule          the next line must NOT produce one for some-rule

Usage:
    check-semgrep-fixture.py <semgrep-json> <fixture-file> <rules-file>
    check-semgrep-fixture.py --self-test
